# Customer Segmentation
Here we are using k-means algorithm to divide customers into various segments based on the age, annual income, and spending score.

## Steps followed:
1. Reading the customer.csv file \
2. Creating a visualization of the data as shown in customer.png \
3. By using the elbow method (inertia) and Silhouette score we will choose the best value for K, from a possible k value of 1 to 10. You should use three features for this process **"Age, spending score, and annual income"**. Then we Create a visualization of the elbow scores as shown in elbow.png \
4. We repeat the above process(No. 3) for each of these category : **"Age and Spending Score", "Age and Annual Income", "Spending Score and Annual Income"**. \
5. Then we Create a cluster diagram for each of the three categories in No. 4 above, similar to cluster.png \
 
I have uploaded my notebook in .html and .py formats.
